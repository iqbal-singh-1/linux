# Built-in directories and files
Here are some built in directories and files that are very important for using linux operating system.
- /etc/shadow :-- all account related details.
- /etc/passwd :-- stores the actual user account and maintains various settings related to accounts.
- /etc/profile :-- to set system-wide environment variables and startup programs for new user shells.
- /etc/bashrc :-- to establish system-wide functions and aliases for new user shells.
- /etc/login.defs :-- contains the user mailbox location, password aging values, the UID and GID ranges, home directory creation, the default umask, and the password encryption hash.
- /etc/skel :-- Any files stored in this directory are automatically copied to the home directory of new user accounts. Profile files and other configurations can be easily set using /etc/skel.
- /etc/sudoers :-- For privilege escalation in RHEL, we use this file.
